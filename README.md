# Portfolio Analysis

What we'll be doing is creating a portfolio of stocks to start with, and then we'll dive into other products as we start grasping the contents.
<br>
We'll break down each section of the portfolio analysis into smaller sub-sections with descriptions of how each line works.
<br>
Then we'll have an overall document with all the codes from that sub-section all put together, without the comments, to see the entire process in actions.

We can read the codes on GitHub, but if you're wanting to try it out then download the file onto your laptop and run it on Jupyter, either JupyterLab or Notebook.
